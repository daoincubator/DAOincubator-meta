## Looking for <a id="looking-for"></a>

Primarily Funding with Advisory input very welcome. We're building Audacity on Audacity. And would like to test the ability of the DAO to cope with partnerships with incubators/accelerators and funding as these are probable requirements \(or at least desirable options\) for most projects. Any funding can be added directly to the DAO and Advisory input converted into equity.
