# Betoken

**Purpose:** Making optimal investment decisions for a decentralized hedge fund.

**Current Stage:** Betoken Beta running on Rinkeby Testnet with ~70 managers, waiting for security audit in order to launch on Mainnet.

## Governed Objects & Mechanics <a id="governed-objects-and-mechanics"></a>

Investment decisions are made by a community of managers, each of whom owns Kairo tokens \(non-transferrable\) denominating the percentage of total funds they can manage. Making profits increases one’s Kairo balance, and making losses decreases it, resulting in a meritocratic Kairo distribution over time. Managers receive a monthly commission based on their Kairo balance, so they’re incentivized to make better investments. Managers may initiate a protocol upgrade via voting with Kairo, and at the same time electing the dev team responsible for protocol maintenance & development. The dev team receives monthly funding from the hedge fund’s AUM.

## Looking for <a id="looking-for"></a>

We need funding to pay for a security audit, legal guidance regarding incorporation & regulations, and technical expertise regarding potential flaws & attack surfaces of the incentive model.
