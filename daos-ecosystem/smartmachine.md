# SmartMachine

**Purpose:** An open smart contracts market owned by the community.‌

**Current Stage:** alpha on main-net‌

## Governed Objects & Mechanics‌ <a id="governed-objects-and-mechanics"></a>

All system will be governed by the DAO, including the code and the git repo. Acceptance of smart modules to be sold on the market by external devs and companies is dependent on DAO voting. All % and everything else is dependent on DAO voting. The election/firing of the board of admins too.Fund distribution by community voting etc. etc.‌

## Looking for <a id="looking-for"></a>

Devs and a little \(very little\) bunch of micro investors, for testing the interaction between investors and the DAO.‌
