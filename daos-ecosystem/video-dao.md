# Video DAO

‌**Purpose:** To manage the Staking and running of a Transcoder on the Livepeer network‌

**Current Stage:**‌

The campaign and project plan has been published on Livepeer's forum: [https://forum.livepeer.org/t/transcoder-campaign-video-dac/](https://forum.livepeer.org/t/transcoder-campaign-video-dac/)​‌

A Transcoder node is running as part of the set of 25 Active transcoders on Livepeer's network, and has amassed a bonded stake of 71,690 LPT \(approximately $578k at today's spot price for LPT\).‌

The node is generating approximately 2 LPT \($16\) every 20.8 hours / 5760 blocks in Ethereum's blockchain.‌

A DAO has been created on Aragon [https://mainnet.aragon.org/\#/video.aragonid.eth/](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/video.aragonid.eth/) and an initial deposit of funds has been made. No votes have yet been proposed.‌

Development of the code for Phase 2 is in progress, to allow a DAO to approve / bond / unbond / withdraw tokens to / from nodes on Livepeer's network.‌

## Governed Objects & Mechanics‌ <a id="governed-objects-and-mechanics"></a>

Livepeer Transcoder configuration, and distribution of funds generated from Inflationary Reward mechanics.‌

## Looking for

Guidance on how to develop the concept, funding for phases of development, community to share these ideas with.[
